            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Repreſentation unto His GRACE HIS MAJESTIES HIGH COMMISSIONER And the Right Honourable the Eſtates of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, anent the Survey of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Navigating the Coaſts and Iſles thereof.</head>
            <p>IN <hi>Anno.</hi> i681, The Lords of Privy Council having appointed <hi>John Adair</hi> to make a Survey of the whole Kingdom, and form particular Mapps of the ſeveral Shires, in Reſpect there were no exact ones done for them, did ordain a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sellary to be payed him for that end, and recommended the deſign to the Nobility, Gentry, and Burrows, for a futeable incouragement to bear its-charge: But after ſeveral Shires were ſurveyed and exact Mapps of them made up, no thing anſwerable to the Work, or charge thereof could be procured either from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or Countrey: So that the deſign was in a manner abandoned untill the year 1686 That the Parliament then ſitting were pleaſed to conſider that exact Geographical Mapps would be both honourable, and uſefull to the Inhabitants, and that true Mapps and Deſcriptions of the Sea Coaſt would not only be Honourable and uſeful, but moſt neceſſary for Navigation, and might prevent many Ship-Wracks, and great loſſes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the want of them in time paſt. And therefore did form and paſs an Act in favours of the ſaid <hi>John Adair,</hi> ordaining him forthwith to goe on in the deſign, and for bearing the charge of Land Mapps did Authorize and impower the Heretors in each Shire to meet and impoſe upon their valued Rent, ſuch a Sume as they ſhould think proper to bear the charge of the work, to be uplifted by the Collectors of the Supply, and by them payed in to the ſaid <hi>John Adair,</hi> when ſurveying or having ſurveyed their reſpective Shires: But this part of the Act being founded only upon a recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the Heretours was not put in Execution, albeit ſeveral Shires were ſurveyed, with reſpect to the ſaid fond, by the ſaid <hi>John Adair</hi> with great Travel and Expence: Likewiſe for bearing the charge of Navigating the Sea Coaſt, and Iſles, and making

Mapps of them, one ſhilling Scots was impoſed upon each Tun of all Ships and other Veſſels belonging to this Kingdom, and two Shillings Scots upon each Tun of Forraign Ships yearly for the ſpace of five years next after the date of the Act, to be uplifted by the Collectors of the Cuſtoms at the ſeveral ports, and by them payed in to the ſaid <hi>John</hi> yearly at <hi>Mertimaſs.</hi> But the preſent War which ſhortly followed after, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence of ſome Collectors, and the fraud of others, rendered this part alſo of very little or no account, albeit <hi>John Adair</hi> in obedience to the Act of Parliament did Survey and Navigat the Sea Coaſt from <hi>Sunderland point</hi> in England to <hi>Buchanneſs,</hi> and delineat the ſame in eight large Mapps including the Firths and Rivers of <hi>Forth</hi> and <hi>Tay:</hi> In which are laid down all the Ports, and Creicks, Headlands, Bayes, Iſlands. Rocks, Sands, Shelves and other hazards, with the marks by which they may be eſcaped, their true bearings and diſtance, the deepings, with the beſt and ordinary places for Anchorage. Which work beſide his hazard and travel coaſt above 300 pound ſtarling: and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſurvey true, and exact, he did buy and bring from Abroad Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Inſtruments and other neceſſars, to the value of 100 pound ſtarling, alſo he brought over from <hi>Holland</hi> one <hi>Moxon</hi> an engraver to whom he payed 70 pound ſtarling which in all will be three times as much as was got from the Collectors upon the account of the Tunnage.</p>
            <p>After all theſe diſcouragements, and diſappointments ſome three years agoe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Noblemen, and Gentlemen from a ſenſe of the uſefulneſs of the ſaid deſign, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the cutting of the Mapps already done, and Printing of them, with a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be way of Subſcriptions and made account that 600 or 700 ſubſeribers might be got at 20 Shill. ſtarling each and the one half being payed <hi>per</hi> advance might bear the Charge, But this project ſucceeded no better than the former, for of that number not one hundred was procured, which being of no proportion to the deſign the money up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifted from the ſubſcribers (except very little) was let remain in the hands of thoſe who received it, and may be returned upon giving up the Receits granted for it. So that the Advance made upon that head, as the buying Capper plates cutting of Mapps bringing home Paper and gathering in the Accounts of natural curioſities and monuments of Antiquity through the Kingdom, for making up the deſcriptions, was performed at the expence of the ſaid <hi>John Adair,</hi> who by it, and what he had beſtowed formerly hath not only ſpent what money he could procure of his own, but alſo hath contracted conſiderable debt, ſo that he is rendered incapable to proceed any farther in ſo good a work.</p>
            <p>This is humbly Repreſented that his Grace his Majeſties Commiſſioner, and High Court of Parliament may know and conſider the ſtate and condition of a deſign which truely concerns the Honour and Intereſt of the Kingdom though more particularly of theſe who travel by Sea, as many ſadd and dayly examples occaſioned by the want of exact Mapps and Deſcriptions of the Sea Coaſt and Iſles of this Kingdom do teſtifie.</p>
            <p>As to the progreſs made in the Work, with an Account of the Money beſtowed upon it, and what in modeſt Computation it will yet coaſt before it can be perfected. The Report of a Committe of the privy Council lately appointed to examine the ſame lying ſubſcribed in the Clerk of the Councils hands, may not only be ſeen, but likewiſe the Mapps, and accounts themſelves are ready to be ſhewn to any who ſhall call for them.</p>
